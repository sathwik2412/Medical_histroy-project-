# Medical Data History SQL Queries

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing medical data using SQL. It includes a series of SQL queries to extract, update, and analyze information from a medical database. The queries range from basic retrieval to complex data manipulations and aggregations.

---

### SQL Schema:
- Ensure that the column `attending_doctor_id` in the `admissions` table is renamed to `doctor_id` to facilitate merging with the `doctors` table.
